# 📂 ML-DL-Projects

A curated collection of **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** projects, organized by problem type. This repository is intended to serve as a growing portfolio of projects demonstrating data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment-ready solutions.

I will continue to add new projects across various ML/DL domains.
